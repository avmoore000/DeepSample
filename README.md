# DeepSample
Audio Processing Project

Audio samples are clips of instrument(s) copied from another song, usually manipulated by changing tempo or speed to 
support or enhance the creation of a new unique song.  Professional music creators sample music by obtaining the sample 
from the original producer by influence and networking.  More amatueur music creators, such as up and coming artists,
often crop raw audio from a song to add to their own.  While an efficient method, cropping raw audio leads to background 
noise from failure to isolate specific instument(s) the user is focused on.  This research will focus on two key components
(a) the comparison of efficiency between four audio segmentation algorithms and (b) the creation of an application "Deep Sample"
that will isolate audio with artificial neural networking methods.  The basis of this research is influence by Fawad Hussain's
Optimized Audio Classificatoin and Segmentation Algorithm by Using Ensemble Methods.

Week of Jan 25 2020

Hue and I developed the main idea of DeepSample, and began searching for research papers
to base our work on.  

Week of Feb 1 2020

Hue created the first draft of our abstract, and I found a paper to base our work on.
I proceeded to email the authors and try to obtain their source.  

Week of Feb 8 2020

Hue finished creating the beginnings of the user interface for DeepSample, I failed to 
receive a response from the author of the research paper, so we decided to proceed 
without the original source.  Hue recommended looking at cepstrum signal analysis, and I 
found several papers using this algorithm and algorithms related to it.  We are planning to 
use these as the basis of our research.

Week of Feb 15 2020
Created a working implementation of the zero-crossing algorithm.  Added a file describing the algorithms we are targeting, and began a works cited list for use in the final paper.

Week of Feb 22 2020
Began the implementation of the spectrum flux and cepstrum algorithms.  Created a skeleton for the ANN to be completed this week. 

Week of Feb 29 2020
Implemented printing of results for both debugging purposes and for sending to the neural network.
